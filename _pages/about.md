Some years back, a colleague and friend of mine, impressed (or maybe faking to be) by the solution I came up with, told me: "This is head is not meant for two legs. This head is meant for FOUR legs!" Hence the nickname "FourLeggedHead", as I once was searching for a unique identifier for a gaming platform. Years have passed and I am probably not as sharp as I used to be. But I kept this nickname, because of its uniqueness... And because of its genesis. Thank you Raj.
