Some years back, a colleague and friend of mine, impressed by the
solution I came up with, told me: "This head is meant for four legs!"
Hence the Id "FourLeggedHead", as I once searched for a unique one.
Years have passed and I am probably not as sharp as I used to be.
But I kept this Id, because of its uniqueness... And because of its
genesis. Thank you Raj.
